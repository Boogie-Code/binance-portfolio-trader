# binance-portfolio-trader
## Written in Python3 with a MySQL database

Populates a users spot, margin (cross AND isolated) and futures data for:

1. Trades
2. Orders
3. Open position dashboards (updated every 1 minute)
4. Loans/Repayments for margin accounts

## Currently working on:

1. Learning Streamlit framework to provide a basic UI, considering going full JS as Streamlit is very limited in functionality
2. Finishing off the initialization of spot open orders/dashboard
3. Starting the futures section
